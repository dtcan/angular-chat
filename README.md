# AngularChat

A simple instant messaging interface made using Angular.

I'm currently working on adding usage guidelines in the wiki.

## Build

You can use the [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) to build this project. The command to build is `ng build`. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Development server

If you have the Angular CLI, you can also run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. If you run `ng serve --host 0.0.0.0`, you'll be able to connect to the server from other devices on your network at `http://192.168.XXX.XXX:4200/`, where 192.168.XXX.XXX is your host device's local IP address.
